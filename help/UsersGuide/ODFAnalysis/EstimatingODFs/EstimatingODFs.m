%% Model ODFs and ODF Estimation
% How to define Model ODFs and recover ODFs from Pole Figure Data or EBSD Data
% 
%%
%
% Estimating ODFs from EBSD or pole figure data is one of the basic
% features of the MTEX toolbox. There is no difference between model ODFs
% and estimated ODFs, since they are both based on the class
% <ODF_index.html ODF>, thus one can compare easily ODFs comming from 
% Pole Figure Data with EBSD of the same sample, or even with an assumed model
% ODF.
