% how to calculate with tensors in MTEX

%% Open in Editor
%
%% Abstract
% MTEX offers some basic functionality to calculate with tensors as they
% occur in material sciense. It allows to define tensors of arbitrary rank,
% e.g., stress, strain, elasticity or piezoelectric tensors, to visuallize
% them and to perform various transformations.
%
%% Contents

%% Defining a Tensor
%
% A tensor is defined by its entries and a crystal symmetry. Let us
% consider a simple example. First we define some crystal symmetry

cs = symmetry('-1');

%%
% Next we define a two rank tensor by its matrix

M = [[10 3 0];[3 1 0];[0 0 1]];
T = tensor(M,cs)

%%
% In case the two rank tensor is diagonal the syntax simplifies to

T = tensor(diag([10 3 1]),cs)

%% Importing a Tensor from a File
% Especially for higher order tensors it is more convinient to import the
% tensor entries from a file. As an example we load the following
% elastic stiffness tensor

fname = fullfile(mtexDataPath,'tensor','Olivine1997PC.GPa');

cs = symmetry('mmm',[4.7646 10.2296 5.9942]);

C = loadTensor(fname,cs,'name','stiffness')


%% Visualization
% The default plot for each tensor is its directional magnitude, i.e. for each direction
% x it is plotted Q(x) = T_ijkl x_i x_j x_k x_l

set_mtex_option('defaultColorMap',seismicColorMap);
plot(C,'complete')

%%
% There are more specialized visuallition possibilities for specific
% tensors, e.g., for the elasticity tensor. See section
% <ElasticityTensor.html Elasticity Tensor>.

%% Rotating a Tensor
% Rotation a tensor is done by the command <tensor_rotate.html rotate>.
% Lets define a rotation

r = rotation('Euler',45*degree,0*degree,0*degree)

%%
% Then the rotated tensor is given by

Trot = rotate(T,r)
plot(Trot)

%% The Inverse Tensor
%
% The inverse of a 2 rank tensor or a 4 rank elasticity tensor is computed
% by the command <tensor_inv.html inv>

S = inv(C)

%% Tensor Products
% In MTEX tensor products are specifies according to Einsteins summation
% convention, i.e. a tensor product of the form T_ij = E_ijkl S_kl has to
% be interpreted as a sum over the indice k and l. In MTEX this sum can be
% computed using the command <tensor_EinsteinSum.html EinsteinSum>

S = EinsteinSum(C,[-1 -2 1 2],T,[-1 -2])

%%
% here the negative numbers indicates the indices which are summend up.
% Each pair of equal negative numbers correspondes to one sum. The
% positive numbers indicate the order of the dimensions of the resulting
% tensor.
%
% Let us consider a second example. The linear compressibility in a certain
% directiom v of a specimen can be computed from it mean elasticity tensor
% E by the formula, c = S_ijkk v_i v_j where S is the complience, i.e. the
% inverse of the elasticity tensor

v = xvector;
c = EinsteinSum(C,[-1 -2 -3 -3],v,-1,v,-2)
