% In texture analysis crystal orientations are used to describe the
% alignment of the crystals within the specimen. A crystal orientation is
% defined as the rotation that maps the specimen coordinate system onto the
% crystal coordinate system. 
%
%%
% The class <orientation_orientation.html *orientation*> is an inheritant of the class <rotation_index.html
% *rotation*> and allow to work with orientation in MTEX.
%
%% Defining a Crystal Orientation
%
% In order to define a crystal orientation one has to define crystal and
% specimen symmetry first.

cs = symmetry('cubic');
ss = symmetry('orthorhombic');

%%
%
% Now a crystal orientation is defined in the same way as a rotation. A
% well known possibility are the so called *Euler angles*. Here two
% conventions are commonly used:
%
% *The Bunge Euler Angle Convention*
%
% Here an arbitrary rotation is determined by three consecutive rotations,
% the first about the z-axis, the second about the y-axis, and the third
% again about the z-axis. Hence, one needs three angles two define an
% orientation by Euler angles. 

o = orientation('Euler',30*degree,50*degree,10*degree,cs,ss)

%%
% *The Matthies Euler Angle Convention*
%
% In contrast to the Bunge conventionen here the three rotations are taken
% about the z-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis.

o = orientation('Euler',30*degree,50*degree,10*degree,'ZYZ',cs,ss)

%%
% *The axis angle parametrisation*
%
% Another posibility to specify an rotation is the give its rotational axis
% and its rotational angle.

o = orientation('axis',xvector,'angle',30*degree,cs,ss)

%%
% *Miller indice*
%
% There is also a Miller indice convention for defining crystal orientations.

o = orientation('Miller',[1 0 0],[0 1 1],cs,ss)

%%
% *Four vectors defining a rotation*
%
% Given four vectors u1, v1, u2, v2 there is a unique rotations q such that 
% q u1 = v1 and q u2 = v2. 

o = orientation('map',xvector,yvector,zvector,zvector,cs,ss)

%%
% *Defining an orientation by a 3 times 3 matrix*

o = orientation('matrix',eye(3),cs,ss)

%%
% *Predifined Orientations*
% 
% In the MTEX there is a list of predefined orientations:
%
% * [[cubeOrientation.html,cubeOrientation]]
% * [[gossOrientation.html,gossOrientation]]
% * [[brassOrientation.html,brassOrientation]]
%
%

o = orientation('goss',cs,ss)

%% Rotating Crystal Directions onto Specimen Directions
%
% Let 

h = Miller(1,0,0,cs)

%%
% be a certain crystal direction and 

o = orientation('Euler',90*degree,90*degree,0*degree,cs,ss)

%%
% a crystal orientation. Then the alignment of this crystal direction with
% respect to the specimen coordinate system can be computed via

r = o * h

%%
% Conversely the crystal direction that is mapped onto a certain specimen
% direction can be computed via the <orientation_mldivide.html backslash operator>

o \ r

%% Concatenating Rotations
%
% Let 

o = orientation('Euler',90*degree,0,0,cs,ss);
rot = rotation('Euler',0,60*degree,0);

%%
% be a crystal orientation and a rotation of the specimen coordinate
% system. Then the orientation of the crystal with respect to the rotated
% specimen coordinate system calculates by

o1 = rot * o



%%
% Then the class of rotations crystallographically equivalent to o can be
% computed in two way. Either by using the command <orientation_symmetrise.html
% symmetrise> 

symmetrise(o)

%%
% or by using multiplication

ss * o * cs

%% Caclulating Missorientations
%
% Let cs and ss be crystal and specimen symmetry and o1 and o2 two crystal
% orientations. Then one can ask for the missorientation between both
% orientations. This missorientation can be calculated by the function
% <orientation_angle.html angle>.

angle(o,o1) / degree

%%
% This missorientation angle is in general smaller then the missorientation
% without crystal symmetry which can be computed via

angle(rotation(o),rotation(o1)) /degree

%% Calculating with Orientations and Rotations
%
% Beside the standard linear algebra operations there are also the
% following functions available in MTEX. Then rotational angle and the axis
% of rotation can be computed via then commands
% <quaternion_angle.html angle(o)> and
% <quaternion_axis.html axis(o)> 

angle(o1)/degree

axis(o1)
%%
% The inverse orientation to o you get from the command
% <quaternion_inverse.html inverse(q)>

inverse(o1)

%% Conversion into Euler Angles and Rodrigues Parametrisation
%
% There are methods to transform quaternion in almost any other
% parameterization of rotations as they are:
%
% * [[quaternion_Euler.html,Euler(o)]]   in Euler angle
% * [[quaternion_Rodrigues.html,Rodrigues(o)]] % in Rodrigues parameter
%

[phi1,Phi,phi2] = Euler(o)


%% Plotting Orientations
% 
% The [[orientation_plot.html,plot]] function allows you to visualize an 
% quaternion by plotting how the standard basis x,y,z transforms under the
% rotation.
