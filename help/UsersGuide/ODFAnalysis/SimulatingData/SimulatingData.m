%% Simulating Data based on ODFs
% How to create experimental data from an ODF

% To analyse the relyability of the ODF estimation simulating data and 
% estimate an ODF from these data again may be usefull. The estimated ODF
% compared to the original allows one to find best parameters for ODF 
% estimation as well as for the experimental design.
